SimpleDeflateDecompressor
=========================

A simple decompressor for data compressed using the DEFLATE algorithm
implemented in TypeScript.

This repository was originally forked from the URL:

	https://github.com/nayuki/Simple-DEFLATE-decompressor

That upstream repository also contains implementations in the languages
C++, Java, and Python that have been discarded in this fork. 
The TypeScript code was retained, but it has had its file structure
reorganized, has been reformatted to different, idiosyncratic
coding standards, and, in some cases, has been slightly refactored.
A simple user interface has also been added.  It is also intended to
add some automated tests at some point in the future..
